"Hello.

I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. My name is chase and I full time freelance web programmer well versed in both React programming and Django.

I made my previous client an e-commerce store that uses React for the front-end user interface and improves the experience by making use of reusable components. For the back-end, I use Django which communicates with the front-end through a REST API.

Both technologies are perfect for blueprints and scale really well. If you're interested in learning more about how I could help you with your project please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Best,

Chase"
