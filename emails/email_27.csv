"Java programming is a versatile, powerful tool that helps developers create robust, high-performance applications. In particular, Java's portability, platform independence, and ease of use make it an ideal programming language for use in a networked application environment. Java's success has been due largely to its ""write once, run anywhere"" portability. This means that a Java program written on one platform, such as Microsoft Windows, can be run on any other platform that has a Java virtual machine, such as Linux or Macintosh. In addition, the Java programming language is easy to learn and use "" what matters most to Core Services is its write code once, Your approach is structured and conforms runs onautomatically on any platform ~~ never needs recompiling Cross platform This enables trueobject-orientatedlescapesc tetransatlanticdivide embedded 8etc
