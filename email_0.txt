Photosynthesis in medicine refers to the use of the process of photosynthesis to assist with healing by harnessing the natural energy of light, organic molecules, and water. Photosynthesis is a biochemical process used by plants and some bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in the form of carbohydrates, the primary energy source of all organisms. Photosynthesis has been used as a medical therapy since the 19th century. Light energy is absorbed by plants and is converted into carbohydrate molecules via a biochemical process. These molecules are then used to provide energy for all cellular functions. In photosynthesis, oxygen is produced as a byproduct. Oxygen is essential for all living organisms, and the increased oxygen levels can improve cell growth and metabolism.

Photosynthesis has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions such as skin problems, asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, obesity, and more. In photosynthesis, wavelengths of light are used to penetrate the skin and stimulate cells which helps improve the healing process. Light therapy is often used in conjunction with traditional medicinal treatments. Light therapy has been used to treat inflammatory skin conditions, improve circulation, and reduce stress. Photosynthesis can also help to reduce the risk of cancer and promote healthy cell growth. Photosynthesis is also known to boost the body’s natural immunity. 

Recent studies have shown that certain frequencies and wavelengths of light can influence the body’s circadian rhythm, helping to improve sleep and reduce stress. Photosynthesis has also been shown
